//filter The filter() method of Array instances creates a shallow copy of a 
//portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array
// that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
//and return the shallowcopy of that array , return empty array if no value pass the
//filter condition (values which remain true for set condition)

const myNums = [10,20,30,40,50];

let receiveNUm = myNums.filter( (value) => value > 20)//no scope therefore implicit return
console.log(receiveNUm);

let receiveValue = myNums.filter( (item) => {
    return item > 20;
});

console.log(receiveValue);

//doing similar task using for each loop since return undefined in case of for each 
//hence we create another array to keep items > 20

let newarr = [];
myNums.forEach( (item) => {
    if(item > 20)
    newarr.push(item);
});

console.log(newarr);
