# javascript
js is primarily prototype based language and classes in js is syntactical sugar added on js  because it provides a more familiar and concise way to create objects and handle inheritance, similar to classical OOP languages like Java or C++. However, under the hood, it still uses prototypes.

JavaScript's inheritance is prototype-based, meaning objects can inherit directly from other objects.
