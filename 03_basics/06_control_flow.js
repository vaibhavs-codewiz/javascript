//short hand notation :

if (score > 100) console.log("working well");

// multiple lines can written without {} by separating with , but not assume as a good practise so avoid using this syntax :

if (score > 30) console.log("its working"), console.log("now also working");

//shift + alt + down arrow (selecting and copying)
