# js is synchronous and single thread language :
Single-threaded: This means JavaScript has one execution thread. Imagine a single lane road where instructions (code) get processed one after another. Only one instruction can be carried out at a time.

Synchronous: This refers to how JavaScript handles tasks. Synchronous means tasks must be completed sequentially, in the order they appear in the code.  Think of it like waiting at a traffic light. The code execution halts  until the current task finishes before moving on to the next one.

* this behaviour of js is default but js not let this weak point to become a major problem (problem major when using standalone js engine) . It is not a problem as there is no js standalone engine present it is always in runtime environment like in browser node 
* 
## js code execution context :
_ the code is executed one line of code ata time in js, each operation waits for last one to get completed . _
