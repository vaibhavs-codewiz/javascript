# API 
* APIs are everywhere!  They are the building blocks that make many of the applications we use daily  powerful and feature-rich.

* API helps our application to enable with the complex features from other resources .
* there can be possibility that both application requesting for some feature and the resource provider are build in different languages , so this issue of communication between them is solve by API which act as common medium known by both .
* api provide as with two things how to communicate (protocol) and what to communicate (data)
* Data Sharing:  APIs allow applications to share data securely, like a weather app getting data from a weather service.

Extend Functionality:  An app can use an API to add features without building them from scratch, like a social media app using a mapping API to show locations.

Communication between Devices:  APIs enable communication between different devices, like a smartwatch syncing data with your phone's fitness app.

* a practical example to understand how api are used :
Imagine a programmer wants to build a weather app. They'll find a weather API and study its documentation.  The documentation will explain what data is available (temperature, forecast, etc.) and how to request it (by city name, zip code, etc.).
The programmer will then write code using a language like Python and an API library to make a request to the weather API, specifying the user's location.  The API will respond with a chunk of data in JSON format. Finally, the programmer will use code to parse the JSON and extract the specific weather information needed for the app (temperature, forecast icons, etc.).
APIs can be complex, but with practice and the right tools, programmers can become experts at navigating the menu and extracting the data they need to build amazing applications!
