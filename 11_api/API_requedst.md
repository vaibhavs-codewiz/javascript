# API 
* APIs are everywhere!  They are the building blocks that make many of the applications we use daily powerful and feature-rich.

* API helps our application to enable with the complex features from other resources .
* there can be possibility that both application requesting for some feature and the resource provider are build in different languages , so this issue of communication between them is solve by API which act as common medium known by both .
* api provide as with two things how to communicate (protocol) and what to communicate (data)
* Data Sharing:  APIs allow applications to share data securely, like a weather app getting data from a weather service.

Extend Functionality:  An app can use an API to add features without building them from scratch, like a social media app using a mapping API to show locations.

Communication between Devices:  APIs enable communication between different devices, like a smartwatch syncing data with your phone's fitness app.

* a practical example to understand how api are used :
Imagine a programmer wants to build a weather app. They'll find a weather API and study its documentation.  The documentation will explain what data is available (temperature, forecast, etc.) and how to request it (by city name, zip code, etc.).
The programmer will then write code using a language like Python and an API library to make a request to the weather API, specifying the user's location.  The API will respond with a chunk of data in JSON format. Finally, the programmer will use code to parse the JSON and extract the specific weather information needed for the app (temperature, forecast icons, etc.).
APIs can be complex, but with practice and the right tools, programmers can become experts at navigating the menu and extracting the data they need to build amazing applications!
* we've got different architectural styles for creating an API because essentially an API.
is just a set of rules and they each decide different rule sets for creating APIs.
* Application Programming Interface, is essentially a set of rules that defines how applications can talk to each other.  Imagine it like a special language with instructions for how to request and receive information.

* use case of api , request response cycle (requesting url, server responding) with api in place of server will send as raw data(send object) which does not lead whole page with html, css, js but help to achieve specific task like in instagram liking the post only increase like couont and does not load whole page is achieve using api call.

* we receive data in JSON format , and access this api using a link also called endpoint .

There are different architectural styles for APIs, kind of like having different dialects in the same language. Each style has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on what you're trying to achieve with your API.
# JSON : javascript object notation
* JSON response is in the form of string .
JSON: The Lightweight Data King

JSON is a text-based format for storing and exchanging data. It's lightweight, human-readable, and language-independent, making it a superstar for data communication between applications.

Think of it as a Simple Language for Data:

Structured Data: JSON organizes data in a hierarchical way using key-value pairs. Keys are like labels, and values are the actual data. Imagine a recipe with ingredients (keys) and quantities (values).
Building Blocks: The basic building blocks of JSON are:
Strings: Text data enclosed in double quotes. ("name": "John Doe")
Numbers: Any numeric value. (3.14, 100)
Booleans: true or false to represent truth values. (true, false)
Arrays: Ordered lists of values, written within square brackets. Each value can be any JSON data type. (["apple", "banana", 1])
Objects: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, written within curly braces. Keys are always strings. ({"name": "Alice", "age": 30})
Example: Here's a JSON object representing a person:

JSON
{
  "firstName": "Bob",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25,
  "hobbies": ["reading", "coding", "gaming"]
}
Use code with caution.

Why is JSON so Awesome?

Readability: JSON is easy for humans to understand, even without a programming background.
Lightweight: It's just plain text, making it efficient for data transfer.
Language Independence: Any programming language can work with JSON data easily. This makes it a universal translator for data exchange.
Simplicity: The structure is straightforward, making it easy to parse and generate.
Where do you see JSON in action?

Web APIs: JSON is the go-to format for exchanging data between web servers and clients (browsers).
Configuration Files: Many applications use JSON to store configuration settings.
Data Storage: JSON is a popular choice for storing lightweight data on the server or client-side.
Mastering JSON unlocks a powerful tool for data communication in your JavaScript projects and beyond.

Remember, JSON is just a format, but it's a fundamental one for web development and data exchange. By understanding its structure and benefits, you'll be well on your way to becoming a data whiz!

* JSON format are received in string form . so to convert json format to js object 
=> JSON.parse(data);
* and to parse js object data into JSON (we do so when we create our api)
=> JSON.stringify(json);

# AJAX (although we are getting JSON response )
AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (although JSON is more common now), is a technique for creating web applications that can update their content without reloading the entire page. This leads to a more fluid and responsive user experience.

Here's how AJAX works:

User Interaction: A user interacts with the web page, like clicking a button or submitting a form.
JavaScript Makes a Request: JavaScript code in the web page initiates an XMLHttpRequest object. This object acts as a messenger to communicate with the web server.
Request Sent to Server: The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request (often containing data) to a specific URL on the web server. This request is asynchronous, meaning the JavaScript doesn't wait for the server's response before continuing.
Server Processes Request: The web server receives the request, processes it (like fetching data from a database), and prepares a response.
Server Sends Response: The web server sends a response back to the web page, typically containing data in JSON format (or sometimes XML, though less common these days).
JavaScript Handles Response: The JavaScript code receives the response from the server. It then parses the data (like JSON) and dynamically updates the HTML content of the web page without reloading the entire page.
Benefits of Using AJAX:

Enhanced User Experience: AJAX creates a smoother and more responsive user experience by avoiding full page reloads.
Faster Performance: Only the requested data is transferred, improving performance compared to full page reloads.
Reduced Server Load: By not reloading the entire page, AJAX reduces the load on the web server.
Dynamic Content Updates: Content can be updated dynamically without affecting the rest of the page.
Examples of AJAX in Action:

Live Chat Applications: Chat messages are often sent and received using AJAX, allowing for real-time communication.
Social Media Feeds: Updates to social media feeds can be fetched and displayed without reloading the entire page.
Infinite Scrolling: As you scroll down a web page, new content is loaded dynamically using AJAX.
While AJAX is a powerful technique, it's important to consider potential drawbacks:

Increased Complexity: Developing AJAX applications can involve more complex JavaScript code compared to traditional web pages.
Backward Compatibility: Older browsers might not support AJAX, so you may need to consider fallback mechanisms.
Overall, AJAX remains a valuable tool for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. By understanding its core concepts and trade-offs, you can effectively leverage it to enhance your web development projects.
